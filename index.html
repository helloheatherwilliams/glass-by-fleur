        <p class="paragraph">
            Fleur has worked for more than 20 years in the financial services 
            sector however has always had a creative itch needing to be 
            scratched!  Having always loved glass and bought many pieces over 
            the years, decided rather than just purchasing beautiful items she 
            wanted to learn how these pieces were created.  Now more than 10 
            years on and having attended many courses, is now creating and 
            producing items in her own right in her home studio.
        </p>

            Inspired by the beauty of nature and the interplay of light. Her 
            pieces are a celebration of organic shapes and the fabulous colours 
            found in glass.
